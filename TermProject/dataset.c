/**
 * Application 2
 * Description: Assume  that  the  college  takes  very  few  transfer  students
 *   and  has  most  of  its  students  stay  for  at  least  one  year
 *   (Hints: no  frequent  insertion  and  deletion  operations).  And  the  maximum  student  number  is  given.  But  it  does  require  a  lot  of  search  operations.  Specifically,  all  of  the  searches are  based  on  student  IDs.  The  major  interfaces  provided by your code should include createDataSet, destroyDataSet, searchID, insertion, deletion.
